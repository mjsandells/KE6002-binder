    "In this notebook will look at a mathematical model used for predator-prey systems. The model we will look at is known as the __Lotka-Volterra__ model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this by first building a deterministic, idealized model for the predator-prey systems. Towards the end of the notebook, we will then introduce __stochastics__ into the equations - so that the model more accurately captures the noise found in real world scenarios. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Defining the equations\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above equation, the parameters can be thought of as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ = growth rate of rabbit population\n",
    "* $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ = growth rate of fox population\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x$ = rabbit (prey) population \n",
    "* $y$ = fox (predator) population\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\alpha$ = growth rate of rabbits\n",
    "* $\\beta$ = death rate of rabbits due to predatation from foxes\n",
    "* $\\gamma$ = natural death rate of foxes\n",
    "* $\\delta$ = factor describing how many consumed rabbits create a new fox\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Meaning of the Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above equations, we can conclude that the Lotka-Volterra model makes several assumptions for the dynamics of predator-prey systems. Some of which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The rabbit population is provided with limitless food\n",
    "* The rate of change of the populations are proportional to their size\n",
    "* The foxes eat only the rabbits, and are entirely dependent on them as a food source\n",
    "* The foxes have unlimited appetite\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modelling Stochasticisty\n",
    "\n",
    "In introducing stochasticity to our models, there are numerous ways that we can choose to model __randomness__. In this notebook, we will model our noise using a very simple uniform distribution with a mean about zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further work, it may be worthwhile to model the noise using __Brownian motion__, and then comparing this to the white noise randomness generated by the __Weiner__ equation, and then finally model the noise using the coloured noise generated by the __Levy__ equations."

    "From the first graph, we observe an oscillatory relationship between the rabbits and the foxes. As the rabbit population grows in size, the foxes have more to eat. This creates more foxes. As there are now more foxes, they more rapidly consume the rabbit population. As the rabbit population is depleted by the large number of foxes, the foxes have less to eat and are therefore depleted as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Errors in the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors in our numerical simulation are due to the integration method chosen for evaluating the rabbit and fox populations. \n",

    "The numerical integration method chosen was the Euler method. Inherrent errors within this method include the stepsize chosen, which contributes to a discretization error, and any rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant error in our program is the discretization error, which can be minimized by decreasing the step-size. It is worth noting that when the step-size is larger, the closed-loop observed becomes a spiral, and the populations diverge. This illustrates that the equations are mathematically \"__unstable__\".\n",

    "Here, we observe that the populations start out relatively stable, but as the simulation evolves the populations begin to oscillate with greater and greater amplitude as the rabbit population is continuously subject to the uniformly distributed noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rabbit population is perturbed out of its steady state, the fox population experiences a non-zero change to its differential, which perturbs it also out of its steady state. Therefore, if a small change is made to only one species, the other species will also be perturbed out of its steady state. This then causes both species to exhibt the oscillatory behaviour observed earlier in this notebook."

In the first section, we created a model which illustrated the oscilatory relationship between the populations. The obtained results agree with the oscilatory relationship found in nature, as illustrated by the empircal evidence above.\n",
